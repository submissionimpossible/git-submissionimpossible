Here's what I learned about Github:

    - Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS) that helps track changes as you work on new software development projects.

    - GitHub is a collaboration platform which helps you in keeping projects completely private, invite the world to collaborate, and   streamline every step of the project.

    - GitHub is also a powerful version control tool.

    - It contains all of your project’s files and revision history. You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files.

    - It provides you with a pull request which let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

    - You can use issues to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub.

    - It provides you with a user profile page which tells people the story of your work through the repositories you're interested in, the contributions you've made, and the conversations you've had.

    - Using markdowns you can minimally style your issues, pull requests, and files (as long as they are .md format!)

    - It also provides you with branching. You can use branches on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project.

    - When you create a repository it exists remotely outside of your local machine. You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two.

    - You can also fork your repository. A fork is another way to copy a repository, but is most commonly used when contributing to someone else’s project. Forking a repository allows you to freely, experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects.
